I am a seasoned Web Developer with over 3 years of experience. I am specialized in WordPress and Woocommerce and have worked directly with clients and agencies.

I develop websites that are clean and modern, fully responsive, mobile-friendly, SEO friendly, and privacy compliant. My main goal and focus is to deliver websites that provide a great user experience Which will be reflecting my clientsâ€™ unique brand.

Being Experienced in both designing and developing, gives me the versatility to handle the website building process from the ground up and to deliver websites as designed. In addition, I have extensive experience in Client Relations and can bridge that gap between the client and the development team. I also conduct training sessions for clients that help them to manage their websites after the launch....
